Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

Predicting how the stock market will perform is one of the most difficult things to do.

The stock market is known for being volatile, dynamic, and nonlinear. Accurate stock price prediction is extremely challenging because of multiple (macro and micro) factors, such as politics, global economic conditions, unexpected events, a company’s financial performance, and so on.

These variables make it extremely difficult for any stock market expert to anticipate the rise and fall of the market with great precision.

But, all of this also means that there’s a lot of data to find patterns in. So, financial analysts, researchers, and data scientists keep exploring analytics techniques to detect stock market trends.

This gave rise to the concept of algorithmic trading, which uses automated, pre-programmed trading strategies to execute orders.

Can we use machine learning as a game-changer in this domain ? machine learning techniques have the potential to unearth patterns and insights we didn’t see before, and these can be used to make unerringly accurate predictions.

Conclusion
The stock market plays a remarkable role in our daily lives. It is a significant factor in a country's GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth.

In this project, I covered the basics of the stock market and how to perform stock price prediction using machine learning.

The LSTM model can be tuned for various parameters such as changing the number of LSTM layers, adding dropout value or increasing the number of epochs. But are the predictions from LSTM enough to identify whether the stock price will increase or decrease? Certainly not!

As I mentioned at the start of the project, stock price is affected by the news about the company and other factors like demonetization or merger/demerger of the companies. There are certain intangible factors as well which can often be impossible to predict beforehand.
